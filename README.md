# Apache Kafka Three Ways: [kafka.troywest.com](http://kafka.troywest.com)

An Open Source Apache Kafka Workshop provided by [Troy-West](http://www.troywest.com), available as a [guided, full day workshop with your team](http://www.troywest.com/workshops).

Project programming materials provided in Java and Clojure :heart_eyes:.

# Goal

To learn the fundamentals, ergonimics, trade-offs, and maturity of Apache Kafka as:

 1. A Message Broker.
 2. A Streaming Compute Platform.
 3. A Distributed Database.
 
Time permitting, we dabble with vendor tooling (KSQL, Kafka-Connect).

# Prerequisites



# Morning

A deep dive into the history and fundamentals of Apache Kafka as a Message Broker.

We learn about the real-time data's unifying abstraction, and explain Kafka via the lens of decisions and trade-offs, focusing on:

1. High Availability
2. Linear Scalability
3. Near Real-Time Compute
 
Primarily a presentation ([kafka.troywest.com](http://kafka.troywest.com)) followed by Q+A session.
